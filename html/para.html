            CS50 (Computer Science 50) is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University and Yale University. In 2016, CS50 became available to high school students as an Advanced Placement Computer Science course. The on-campus version is Harvard's largest class with 800 students, 102 staff and up to 2,200 participants in their regular hackathons.[1][2]

            The course material is available online for free on the EdX platform, with a range of certificates available for a fee. As of 2022, this online version, called CS50x, teaches the programming languages C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also teaches fundamental computer-science concepts including arrays and data structures, and the Flask web framework.[3] The 2021 iteration of the course introduced three new additional lectures on computer security, artificial Intelligence, and the ethics of technology.[4]

            I got introduced with superhero movie genre when I saw the advertisement of 'Avengers' in 'The Times of India.' It was a fine afternoon, we were in the library and if it wasn't for Anish, I would have ignored this ad as was my habit in those days. He noticed this ad and becomes really excited, "Ironman, Hulk, Thor, Captain America and Black Widow, all in one movie, this is going to be the real deal." I can see him caught in a debate, whether or not he should rip this ad out and keep the poster for himself. I'm not going to spill the beans on what he did with the paper but he obviously did me a favour and opened up a door to infinite storylines I had never given any real thought before. These were the days when he used to narrate me stories of these wonderful almost magical movies. I mean the directors were very cautious to paint everything in science and logic but it was anything but absurd for an average curious science student, so I used to consume it as magic.

            I see evolution of my cinematic taste as an incremental utilitarian probabalistic algorithm. I quickly jumped from MCU to DCU all thanks to Mr. Christopher Nolan once I passed my 12th, which then slowly paved way for consumption of broader spectrum of genres.

            An important step in this journey was "Game of Thrones." I watched it's first episode at my friend's house and I decided to watch the whole season and later all seasons. The only being I was committed to by then was mathematics so it was a huge step. Unfortunately, writers of GOT enabled me to outgrow this teenage crush by the time season 8 ended.@
